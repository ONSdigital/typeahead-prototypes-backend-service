## Run Locally

You'll need [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) to run this project locally.

The version of node required is outlined in [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc).

### Using nvm (optional)

If you work across multiple Node.js projects there's a good chance they require different Node.js and npm versions.

To enable this we use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to switch between versions easily.

1. [install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)
2. Run nvm install in the project directory (this will use .nvmrc)

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start a local server

```bash
yarn start
```

Once the server has started the API will be available at <http://localhost:9000>

## Deployments

The app is automatically deployed to Heroku any time a commit is pushed to master. The Heroku instance is currently on Richard McCarthy's Heroku account <richard.mccarthy.ons@gmail.com>
